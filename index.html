        <ul>
            <li><a class="links" href="http://sfcd.com/">SFCD</a></li>
                <p class="linkcap1">This is a pretty neat sight. There is a lot going on and it's very visually appealing.</p>
            <li><a class="links" href="http://www.cryptarismission.com/">Cryptaris</a></li>
                <p class="linkcap1">What I like about this site is that it seems very complex when you first see if but it's really quiet clean and simplistic. That clean asthetic really appeals to me.</p>
            <li><a class="links" href="http://34.ge/en">Beer 34</a></li>
                <p class="linkcap1">What really sticks out to me about this site is it's extremely consistent art style. They stick to a 3 color pallet and the art work is all the same style with appealing graphics.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p id="questext1">The Cryptaris website was really facinating to me. I'm absolutly sure that the 3D affect is faked with static images layered on eachother and Javascript is telling it how to warp the perspective in relation to the cursor.</p></li>
            <li><p id="questext2">The SFCD sight is very well done. I'm curiour how the motion graphics were acheived. Did they use a program like After Effects? Is a actually a video? Is it a image sequence?</p></li>
